# ExcelScripts (with a touch of CSV)

This repo is just a collection of python scripts for various operations on excel files. Look around, hopefully there is something useful for you.

I plan to continually refactor things over time, but most things will probably be poorly documented, have few use cases, and be quickly coded.

In the future this may turn into a python package.
